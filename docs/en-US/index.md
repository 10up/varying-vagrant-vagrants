### Varying Vagrant Vagrants Objectives

* Provide an approachable development environment with a modern server configuration.
* Continue to work towards a stable state of software and configuration included in the default provisioning.

### [Helpful Extensions](#extensions)

Supporting init scripts during provisioning allows for some great extensions of VVV core.

* [Variable VVV](https://github.com/bradp/vv) automates setting up new sites, setting up deployments, and more.
* [HHVVVM](https://github.com/johnjamesjacoby/hhvvvm) is an HHVM configuration for VVV.
* The [WordPress Meta Environment](https://github.com/iandunn/wordpress-meta-environment) is a "collection of scripts that provision the official WordPress.org websites into a Varying Vagrant Vagrants installation."
* [VVV Provision Flipper] (https://github.com/bradp/vvv-provision-flipper) allows for easy toggling between VVV provisioning scripts.

#### Custom Dashboards

The dashboard provided by VVV allows for easy replacement by looking for a `www/default/dashboard-custom.php` file. The community has built several great dashboards that may be more useful than the bare info provided by default:

* @topdown's [VVV Dashboard](https://github.com/topdown/VVV-Dashboard)
* @leogopal's [VVV Dashboard](https://github.com/leogopal/VVV-Dashboard)
* @stevenkword's [VVV Dashboard Custom](https://github.com/stevenkword/vvv-dashboard-custom)
* @goblindegook's [VVV Material Dashboard](https://github.com/goblindegook/vvv-material-dashboard)
