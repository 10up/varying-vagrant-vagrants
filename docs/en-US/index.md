## Getting Started

These guides are intended to help with the initial installation of VVV as well as to provide ongoing support as you get familiar with its configuration.

* [Install VVV](installation/index.md)
* [Add New Sites](adding-a-new-site/index.md)
* [Need usernames and passwords? Find out the default credentials for the built in sites here](default-credentials.md)

## Other

* [VM Options](vm_config.md)
* [vvv-custom.yml reference](vvv-config.yml.md)

## Help

See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)

## Helpful Extensions

Supporting init scripts during provisioning allows for some great extensions of VVV core.

* [Variable VVV](https://github.com/bradp/vv) automates setting up new sites, setting up deployments, and more.
* [WordPress Meta Environment](https://github.com/WordPress/meta-environment) is a "collection of scripts that provision the official WordPress.org websites into a Varying Vagrant Vagrants installation."

## Custom Dashboards

The dashboard provided by VVV allows for easy replacement by looking for a `www/default/dashboard-custom.php` file. The community has built several great dashboards that may be more useful than the bare info provided by default:

* @topdown's [VVV Dashboard](https://github.com/topdown/VVV-Dashboard)
* @leogopal's [VVV Dashboard](https://github.com/leogopal/VVV-Dashboard)
* @stevenkword's [VVV Dashboard Custom](https://github.com/stevenkword/vvv-dashboard-custom)
* @goblindegook's [VVV Material Dashboard](https://github.com/goblindegook/vvv-material-dashboard)
